I think that I shall never see<br>
A graph more lovely than a tree.<br>
A tree whose crucial property<br>
Is loop-free connectivity.<br>
A tree that must be sure to span<br>
So packets can reach every LAN.<br>
First, the root must be selected.<br>
By ID, it is elected.<br>
Least-cost paths from root are traced.<br>
In the tree, these paths are placed.<br>
A mesh is made by folks like me,<br>
Then bridges find a spanning tree.<br>
