        <h2>What is a personal computer?</h2>

        <p>According to Wikipedia and other sources,
            a personal computer is a multi-purpose computer whose size, capabilities,
            and cost make it accessible for individual use.
            Personal computers were originally designed and planned to be operated straight by an
            end-user (someone like you or me), instead of being used only by a computer
            scientist or specialist.</p>

        <p>In 1961 Wilkes was assigned to the creation of the LINC, the first interactive personal computer. She
            designed
            and wrote the system software as well as the interactive operating system</p>
        <p>Mary Allen Wilkes is also known to be the first person to ever have a PC in their home.</p>

        <H2>The LINC</H2>
        <p>In 1961, Wilkes was assigned to a prominent new project, the creation of the LINC. As one of the
            world’s
            first interactive personal computers, it would be a breakthrough device that could fit in a single
            office or
            lab. It would even have its own keyboard and screen, so it could be programmed more quickly, without
            awkward
            punch cards or printouts. The designers, who knew they could make the hardware, needed Wilkes to
            help write
            the software that would let a user control the computer in real time.</p>

        <p>For two and a half years, she and a team toiled away at flow charts, pondering how the circuitry
            functioned,
            how to let people communicate with it. “We worked all these crazy hours; we ate all kinds of
            terrible food,”
            she says. There was sexism, yes, especially in the disparity between how men and women were paid and
            promoted, but Wilkes enjoyed the relative comity that existed among the men and women at Lincoln
            Labs, the
            sense of being among intellectual peers. “We were a bunch of nerds,” Wilkes says dryly. “We were a
            bunch of
            geeks. We dressed like geeks. I was completely accepted by the men in my group.” When they got an
            early
            prototype of the LINC working, it solved a fiendish data-processing problem for a biologist, who was
            so
            excited that he danced a happy jig around the machine
        </p>


        <p>In late 1964, after Wilkes returned from traveling around the world for a year, she was asked to
            finish
            writing the LINC’s operating system. But the lab had been relocated to St. Louis, and she had no
            desire to
            move there. Instead, a LINC was shipped to her parents’ house in Baltimore. Looming in the front
            hall near
            the foot of the stairs, a tall cabinet of whirring magnetic tapes across from a refrigerator-size
            box full
            of circuitry, it was an early glimpse of a sci-fi future: Wilkes was one of the first people on the
            planet
            to have a personal computer in her home. (Her father, an Episcopal clergyman, was thrilled. “He
            bragged
            about it,” she says. “He would tell anybody who would listen, ‘I bet you don’t have a computer in
            your
            living room.’ ”) Before long, LINC users around the world were using her code to program medical
            analyses
            and even create a chatbot that interviewed patients about their symptoms.</p>
