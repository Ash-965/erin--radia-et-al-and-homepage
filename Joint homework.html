                        Wales</a> in 2018, Clare is
                    passionate about inspiring young people, particularly girls to
                    consider careers in cyber security
                    and STEM
                    subjects.
                    <br>She has worked with schools, in the community and even with the
                    Brownies and Guides to deliver

                    days. Having worked with people as young as 5 via her outreach
                    programme, Clare wants to encourage
                    young people
                    to be interest in technology but to also make them think about what
                    goes on behind the technology to
                    make it
                    work. <br> <br>

                <p> <br> Clare describes Cyber Security as 'one of the most exciting,
                    varied and challenging industries'
                    in her
                    article,

                </p>
                <p>
                    Here she talks about attending a meeting early on in a senior
                    position in cyber security and how
                    there was
                    only one other female present and her role was the minute taker.
                    <br> Within this she talks of the
                    belitting
                    behaviour and assumptions made by others within meetings.
                    <br>However she states, "Women aren't
                    neccessarily
                    better,
                    but we are different... We all bring something different
                    to the party."
