                    You would be forgiven for thinking that everything we take for granted in the world of
                                computer science and technology
                                was created by men.Yet away from the public eye there have been women inventing,
                                innovating and
                                and pioneering the methods that have shaped how we use the internet today. Over the
                                decades these women have dedicated their lives to the advancement of computer
                                technology,
                                yet to many of us, they have been as little more visible than ghosts. This website is
                                dedicated to some of those women.
