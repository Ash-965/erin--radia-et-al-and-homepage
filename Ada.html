          <p class="earlyLife">
            Ada was born on 10th December 1815 in London. More than a century
            before the launch of the world’s first electronic general purpose
            computers. She is commonly regarded as the world’s first programmer
            based on her work with Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLife">
            Ada had an early start in STEM. Lady Byron, her mother, was a
            mathematician who was referred to as the ‘Princess of
            Parallelograms’ by her husband, infamous poet Lord Byron.
          </p>
          <p class="earlyLife">
            From age 4, Lovelace received tutoring in science and maths. Which
            is a remarkable course of study for a woman in the 19th Century.

          <p>
            When she was 12 her mother fell ill and went away to receive
            treatment. Young Ada designed a flying machine in order to travel to
            be with her mother. Ada loved machines and she studied the anatomy
            birds to figure out the mechanics of flight. She even went as far as
            conceptualising what powered flight might look like.
          </p>

          <p>
            In a recorded letter to her mother she wrote, “I have got a scheme,
            to make a thing in the form of a horse with a steam engine in the
            inside so contrived as to move an immense pair of wings, fixed on
            the outside of the horse, in such a manner as to carry it up into
            the air while a person sits on its back.”

              <p>
                Ada Lovelace came up with the first ever written program to make
                a machine function. She worked with Charles Babbage, the
                inventor of an early calculator that was based on a finite
                number of possible calculations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item" id="c2">
              <p>
                Ada realised that a machine could follow a series of simple
                instructions, a program, to perform complex calculations.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="carousel-item" id="c3">
              <p>
                Ada translated his work and added her own algorithm notes, which
                led to the development of the Analytical Engine, the earliest
                version of a computer. This ‘computer’ was just theoretical and
                was never built, so Ada never saw her programming put into
                practice.

          A programming language was named after Ada. In 1979, the U.S.Dept of
          Defence developed a programming language called ‘Ada’, designed to
          override and supersede the hundreds of different programming languages
          in use by the military. This language is still used today.
