                Radia Perlman was born in Portsmouth, Virginia in 1951.
                In 1976 she graduated with a Masters in Mathematics from MIT.
                In 1988 she completed her PhD in Computer Science at the
                same institution, writing her <a
                    href=" https://groups.csail.mit.edu/ana/Publications/PubPDFs/Radia.Perlman.Thesis.1988.pdf"
                    target="_blank">
                    thesis </a> on computer networks that
                would be resistent to malfunction.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working for Digital Equipment Corp in the 1980s, Radia developed a protocol that allowed
                bridges within a Local Area Network to communicate with one another, without getting stuck
                in redundant loops.
                She named this innovation the <a href="Radia Page 2.html" target="_blank">Spanning Tree
                    Protcol</a>.
                It has shaped the way we interact with the world online ever since, and earned Radia a nick-name that
                she would rather forget, Mother of the Internet. 
                In 2004, building on her original invention, she devised Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links, more commonly known
                as TRILL.</p> 
                <p>Radia Perlman continues to be a leading authority in compter science and
                who has won many awards for her work. She was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame in 2014, and is currently a
                Fellow of Dell Technologies.
